- 👋 Hi, I’m @aMartianDuststorm
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Blender and sometimes API's
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... API's and using data to drive 3D creation in Blender
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Blender projects! Because they are massive and I am only just learning what I'm doing. Arguable still don't know what I'm doing.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Can people message me here? Or comment? I'm still learning Github.
